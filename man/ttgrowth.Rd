\title{
A function to process and plot TreeTalker radial growth data.
}
\description{
The function makes use of data frames created by the "ttScrape()" function. It processes data from GP2Y0A21 Sharp distance sensors. The sensors are deployed to measure stem radial growth. The distance sensor is positioned at few centimeters away from the tree trunkâ€™s surface and kept in place by a carbon fiber stick anchored in the xylem. The "ttGrowth()" function converts the digital numbers into distance (mm) and applyes a temporal averaging (median) on weekly basis.
